# description
# A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by removing zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.

# More generally, we can say that for a sequence of size n, we can have (2n â€“ 1) non-empty sub-sequences in total.

    n = len(arr)

    # Run a loop for each combination of bits

        for j in range(n):
            # Check if j-th bit is set in the binary representation of i
            if (i & (1 << j)) > 0:
                subarr.append(arr[j])
